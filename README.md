# Food Delivery System - Project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

## Project Overview

This project is aimed at developing a **Food Delivery System** using **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as a final-year project. The system allows users to browse food items, place orders, and have them delivered to their location. It includes functionalities for users, administrators, and optionally, delivery personnel.
